# Titanic-dataset

Hello everyone, I am excited to present my first independent project, the Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset. In this project, I utilized the 'Decision Tree Classifier' machine learning model to achieve remarkable results. The accuracy of my predictions stands at an impressive 0.99, with weighted average precision, recall, and F1 score reaching 0.99.

As a beginner in the field, I welcome any constructive feedback and suggestions to further improve this project 😊😋. My aim is to contribute to the open-source community, and I look forward to enhancing this project based on your valuable input. Thank you!

## Areas Needing Help

- I faced difficulties in effectively handling the missing values (NaN) present in the Age feature. Despite my efforts, I couldn't devise a satisfactory solution, leading me to make the decision to drop those NaN values from the dataset.
- I seek improvement in data visualization and prediction capabilities.
